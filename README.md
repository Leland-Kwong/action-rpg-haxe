## Core game mechanic (hook)

Kill lots of enemies, collect loot, upgrade gear, upgrade abilities.

### Player experience

- [ ] ability to `pull` enemies by triggering aggro after hitting them. An enemy will be aggro'd when it gets hit and can see the player.
- [ ] once an enemy is aggro'd it will follow the target until the target moves out of sight. Once that happens, the enemy will move until the last known target's position.
