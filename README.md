### Story & Concepts

#### Player's orb companion

The player can have more than one orb and uses these orbs to power different abilities.

### Passive Tree Ideas

#### Basic nodes
* Increased action speed
* Cooldown reduction
* Flat increased maximum health
* Percent increased maximum health

#### Special nodes
* Strength in Numbers - Increases maximum number of spider bots.
* Swarm
  Summon twice the number of bots. Bots decay over time. Decay 10% health/sec.
* Rampage - Increased damage at the expense of health. Each time you hit an enemy you gain a rampage stack. Each rampage stack increases health cost by a percentage of the ability's energy cost and increases damage by X%.
